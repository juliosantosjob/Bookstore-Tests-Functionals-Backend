# Cypress-Tests-Functionals-API

## Description

This is a backend testing automation project for the BookStore application, aiming to ensure that all critical parts of the application function correctly in different scenarios.

# How to Execute the Project

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- NodeJS: [Download and install the latest version of Node.js.](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm: Usually installed automatically with Node.js, but you can check by typing `npm -v` in the terminal.
- Git: to download the project.

## Configuration

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/juliosantosjob/Cypress-Tests-Functionals-API.git 
  ```

2. Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
  ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project to set up the necessary environment variables. In the root of the project, there is a file called `.env.example`. Use this file as a template to fill in your variables, example:

  ```bash
LOCAL=http://localhost:3000
STAGING=<Base URL informed in the readme>
PROD=https://example.com

NAME=<name_example>
PASSWORD=<password_example>
USER_ID=<id_user_example>
  ```

## Creating a user in the Bookstore API to run the test

The Bookstore API enables the creation of new users through POST requests. Follow the steps below to create a user:

1. Make a POST request to the following URL: `https://bookstore.toolsqa.com/Account/v1/User`.

2. In the request body, provide the user data in JSON format. Here's an example:

  ```json
  {
    "userName": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password"
  }
  ```

3. If the request is successful, the API will return a response indicating the successful creation of the user. An example response could be:

  ```json
  {
    "userId": "12345",
    "userName": "your_username",
    "status": "User created successfully"
  }
  ```

## Tests
